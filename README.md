It is an expense-splitting application that simplifies the process of sharing bills and expenses among friends, roommates, or colleagues. It allows users to easily create groups, add expenses, and calculate each person's share, eliminating the need for manual calculations and potential conflicts.
For example, there are group of friends (simran,anchal,parul,anita) and they have made expenses and there are dependencies like anchal owes $20 to simran, simran owes $200 to parul and parul owes $50 to anita. So this is easy for you to split bills in a balanced equation but what if I have a lot of people in my group? It becomes an complex network and you want to make it simpler so that the total number of transactions get minimised and splitting gets easy. Hence it has a feature of minimizing the cash flow between persons.
